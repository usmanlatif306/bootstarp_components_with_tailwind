# Bootstarp Components With Tailwind Css

All developers know very well about bootstrap and most was using it for a long time. With bootstrap you have build in different components which saves a lot of time of developers. But with bootstrap it comes with not much utilities classes and sometime we have to write down custom css as well that makes developers beared a lot of tensions. But with come of tailwind life of developer has become more easy as it is utility-first CSS framework packed with classes. But when we compared it with bootstrap we have to write down css classes for every component then bootstrap who provides build in components. It has created problem for me so I decided to make some bootstrap components make with tailwind.

# Components

Currently it is supporting following components:<br/>
Alerts <br />
Badges <br />
Button <br />
Card <br />
Form Components <br />

# Working

You just need to override your main tailwind css class with this style.css code. It automatically compiled css and you can start using components in your website. Like "btn btn-primary", "btn btn-sm btn-success" etc...

# Important Note

While working with forms tailwind requires form plugin. Don't forget to install it first before working on forms.
